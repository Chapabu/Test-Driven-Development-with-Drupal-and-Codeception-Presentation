<h2>What feature do we want to implement?</h2>

<div class="fragment">
    <pre><code class="gherkin">
        Scenario: Authors should be able to create Articles
        Given I have a user named "Bill"
        And "Bill" has the role of Author
        When "Bill" tries to create an Article node
        Then "Bill" should see the node/add page for an Article
        And "Bill" should be able to create an Article node
    </code></pre>
